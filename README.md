# ERC-20 (contract approval extension)
 this is a custom erc-20 implementation that has an additional function that allows the owner to unlock tokens potentially sent to the contract by accident, many things aren't up to date and this is only meant as a personal experiment, please use https://www.openzeppelin.com/ or other audited libraries
